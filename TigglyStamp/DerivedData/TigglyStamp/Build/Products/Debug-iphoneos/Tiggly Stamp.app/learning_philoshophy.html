            <p class="paragraph">At Tiggly, we design toys that interact with learning apps because we believe there is a powerful learning opportunity in the combination of physical and digital play.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Digital play alone has many benefits on its own right: a digital platform can adapt to a child’s skills and knowledge; it can provide feedback, guidance, and structure targeted to the child’s needs; it can track a child’s performance and assess his or her development by providing instant reports of a child’s learning progression to their parents and teachers; and it can be sometimes even more fun to play with than a toy car or a teddy bear!</p>
            <p class="paragraph">However, what’s missing in a digital setting is the valuable interaction that comes with playing with real objects: grabbing objects in hand, holding them, placing them on a target, and otherwise manipulating them. Seventy years of research on children’s development -- from 20th century education and psychology revolutionaries like Maria Montessori and Jean Piaget to today’s cognitive scientists -- tells us that physical play is extremely important for proper childhood development. What’s obvious is that playing with objects aids the development of motor skills and improves hand-eye coordination. What’s not as obvious is that physical play also helps cognition and memory.</p>
            <div class="pholishophy-img">
                <table width="100%">
                    <td  align="right"><img src="pic_2.png" /></td>
                <td  align="left"><img src="pic_1.png" /></td>
                    </table>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Holding an object in hand stabilizes your child’s head and focuses his attention while he visually and manually explores the object. Have you ever noticed that a 2-year-old constantly looks all around , moving his head in all directions? But as soon as he’s engaged with a toy, all his attention is focused on that toy. Attention to objects is a positive thing, because when children focus on something, there is a better chance for them to learn its name and develop their language skills. But it’s not just about learning names — it’s about learning a whole lot about the world around them. Attending to objects, visually and manually exploring them, acting on them, and inspecting the results of our actions around usisthe basis of all learning.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">What’s important in learning is to engage all our senses. Take a circle as an example. When your child looks at a circle on a screen, she can see the shape. But when she grabs and holds a circular toy in hand, she also touches and feels the roundness of it. She notices that she can roll her circular toy but not her triangular one. She discovers that the circle looks the same when she spins it, but her triangle looks different as she rotates it. Manual interaction with physical blocks helps her understand that not only do a circle and triangle look different but they also have different properties and can be manipulated in different ways. It’s an early “aha moment”: “So that’s why wheels are round and not triangular!”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">However, as great as a triangle ora circle block is, it can never speak to your child. Your child can play with a block for hours and hours, explore it in all directions and manipulate it in many ways, but may never know the name of its shape. It may take even longer for him to realize if he puts together two triangles he can make a square, or that he can draw a cow with two squares!</p>
            <p class="paragraph">That’s where Tiggly’s educator-designed apps come in.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In our digital world, the sky is the limit for imagination. A child can catch stars or stamp circles in an ocean to make a seahorse or a dolphin. She can put together a circle and two squares to draw an elephant in a mysterious jungle. The triangle on the screen may jokingly say to her, “I’m a triangle! I bet you’re not!”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">And that’s why we think there is an immense educational opportunity when physical play and digital play come together. Your child gets all the benefits of interacting with real objects whiletheir imagination is stimulated in a digital context. They receive appropriate guidance in their learning and are given new challenges as their understanding advances. In this way, Tiggly is reimagining play— by bridging the gap between established educational standards and the new digital frontier.</p>
