    <p class="para-title rockwell-bold">Privacy policy</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Tiggly is committed to helping preschoolers learn in the most effective way possible. We believe the ideal way to achieve that goal is by combining physical play with digital tools, and by actively involving parents in the learning process.</p>
    
    <p class="paragraph">This privacy policy has been created to provide you with information about how we collect and use information that you may provide through our apps, the circumstances under which we may disclose that information, as well as your choices concerning that information.</p>
    <ol class="privacy-list">
    	<li>Effective Date: This Privacy Policy is effective 09/20/2013, and applies to any and all information that a user may have provided to Tiggly through our apps.  Tiggly reserves the right, at its discretion and/or in compliance with applicable law if needed, to change, modify, amend, add, or remove portions of its Privacy Policy at any time.  When required by law, we will advise you of such changes.  Modifications will be effective immediately, and will apply to your continuing use.</li>
        <li>Your Consent: Please read this privacy policy carefully.  By accessing and using our apps, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy, and agree to be legally bound by it. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using our apps.</li>
        <li><p class="paragraph">Personal Information and Children: We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.  We do allow children to record their voice within the app; however, that recording is not collected on our servers, and instead is stored locally, only in the app and on the device.  We do not receive the voice recording.</p>
        	<p class="paragraph">If Tiggly learns that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from children under the age of 13 through our apps, we will take reasonable measures to promptly delete any such data from Tiggly’s records.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Personal Information and Adults: Through our apps, Tiggly may collect the following information <span class="italick">from parents</span>:
        	<ul class="reset privacy-info">
                <li>Parent’s name or user name</li>
                <li>Email address</li>
                <li>Have two kids at home? Encourage them to share the shapes and collaborate on their creations!</li>
                <li>Your child(ren)’s age(s)</li>
                <li>Your child(ren)’s gender(s)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Providing the above information is optional. Your name/username, if provided, would be used for keeping track of your information and your child(ren)’s in-game data such as frequency of play, accuracy, mistakes and their strategies. This information will be used to prepare personalized reports to parents about their child(ren)’s progress and learning.  Your email address is collected only if you subscribe to our newsletter or for email updates and reports. We include information on how to unsubscribe from such communications within every email that we send.</p>
            <p>We ask for your child(ren)’s first name(s), age(s) and gender(s) so that we may personalize communications sent to you related to your child(ren)’s progress within the app.  Such information is optional.</p>
            <p>You can contact us by email to request to see or delete any personally identifiable information we have stored.  To make such a request, please email us at <a href="#">privacy@tiggly.com</a>. If needed, we may ask for additional information to verify your identity prior to completing such a request.</p>

        	Collection of Non-Personal Information: Tiggly collects certain non-personally identifiable information from our users, such as data about how our apps are used and device IDs.  We do not combine personal information with non-personal information.  Anonymous, non-personal data is used for internal operations, such as analyzing the effectiveness of our apps, improving our features, and for other, similar purposes.

        <li>
        	<p>Third Parties: Tiggly may use third parties to assist in the analysis of our apps, including analyzing the general behavior and characteristics of users participating in our app.  In doing so, we may share non-personal data, such as your device IDs with third parties.  That anonymous information provided to third parties is used for the purpose of measuring the performance of our app, page views, number of visitors, and similar statistical measures.  The anonymous information is collected through features of the apps and through cookies.</p>
            <p>A “cookie” is a small bit of record-keeping information that websites often store on a user's computer.  You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your device.</p>

            <p>Certain features that Tiggly may offer, such as social networking, may use third party services to provide authentication with a social networking ID.

        <li>Data Retention: Tiggly only retains the data collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy for the period of time necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.   After such time, Tiggly deletes all such data within a time frame that is reasonable for our operating requirements.  When necessary, Tiggly may retain data to the extent needed to resolve disputes, enforce Tiggly user agreements, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of the apps.</li>
        <li><p>Disclosure of Data: If needed in order to operate our apps, personal and non-personal information we collect may be shared with our service providers who support and administer the internal operations of our apps, such as maintaining user accounts and providing customer service.  All such service providers are required to agree to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the data, and may not use it for any other purposes.</p>
        <p>We also reserve the right to release personal information in connection with a lawsuit or legal claim, to comply with a judicial process or law enforcement investigation, or in connection with a corporate change or dissolution, including for example a merger, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation, bankruptcy, liquidation, sale of assets, wind-down of business or related due diligence. Any such release of data will be done in compliance with applicable law, and only if the receiving party agrees to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of that information.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Security: Tiggly follows reasonable and generally accepted industry standards regarding data security, and we maintain reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the confidentiality, security and integrity of the information in Tiggly’s possession in accordance with applicable law.  Only those persons with a need to process user data in connection with the fulfillment of their tasks in accordance with the purposes of this Privacy Policy and for the purposes of performing technical maintenance have access to user data in Tiggly’s possession.</p>
        <p>Tiggly stores all data and information in secure operating environments and implements reasonable and generally accepted industry practices to prevent unauthorized access to the data.
