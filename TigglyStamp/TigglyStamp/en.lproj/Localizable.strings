"kPrivacyPolicytext" = "Tiggly is committed to helping preschoolers learn in the most effective way possible. We believe the ideal way to achieve that goal is by combining physical play with digital tools, and by actively involving parents in the learning process.\n\nThis privacy policy has been created to provide you with information about how we collect and use information that you may provide through our apps, the circumstances under which we may disclose that information, as well as your choices concerning that information.\n\n1.	Effective Date: This Privacy Policy is effective 09/20/2013, and applies to any and all information that a user may have provided to Tiggly through our apps.  Tiggly reserves the right, at its discretion and/or in compliance with applicable law if needed, to change, modify, amend, add, or remove portions of its Privacy Policy at any time.  When required by law, we will advise you of such changes.  Modifications will be effective immediately, and will apply to your continuing use.\n\n2.

If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using our apps.\n\n3.	Personal Information and Children: We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.  We do allow children to record their voice within the app; however, that recording is not collected on our servers, and instead is stored locally, only in the app and on the device.  We do not receive the voice recording.\n\nIf Tiggly learns that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from children under the age of 13 through our apps, we will take reasonable measures to promptly delete any such data from Tiggly’s records.\n\n4.

Your name/username, if provided, would be used for keeping track of your information and your child(ren)’s in-game data such as frequency of play, accuracy, mistakes and their strategies. This information will be used to prepare personalized reports to parents about their child(ren)’s progress and learning.  Your email address is collected only if you subscribe to our newsletter or for email updates and reports. We include information on how to unsubscribe from such communications within every email that we send.\n\nWe ask for your child(ren)’s first name(s), age(s) and gender(s) so that we may personalize communications sent to you related to your child(ren)’s progress within the app.  Such information is optional.\n\nYou can contact us by email to request to see or delete any personally identifiable information we have stored.

Any such release of data will be done in compliance with applicable law, and only if the receiving party agrees to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of that information.\n\n10.	Security: Tiggly follows reasonable and generally accepted industry standards regarding data security, and we maintain reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the confidentiality, security and integrity of the information in Tiggly’s possession in accordance with applicable law.
